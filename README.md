JPA/Hibernate Java 8  Extras
==============================

This is a small library that improves support of Java 8 language features to JPA/Hibernate. It adds:
  * Better support for entity manager injection using mixin-like inheritance
  * Better support for transactional code
  * Support for LocalDate/LocalDateTime persistence
  * Support for persisting lambdas
  * Schema Generation - well this is not actually Java 8 specific
